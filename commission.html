<h3 style="color:orange;"> Commission </h3>
<p style="color:green;"> A commission is a service charge assessed by a broker or investment advisor for providing investment advice or handling purchases and sales of securities for a client.<br><br>

There are important differences between commissions and fees, at least in the way these words are used to describe professional advisors in the financial services industry. A commission-based advisor or broker makes money by selling investment products such as mutual funds and annuities and conducting transactions with the client's money.<br><br>

A fee-based advisor charges a flat rate for managing a client's money. This may be either a dollar amount or a percentage of assets under management (AUM). Sales between family members are often gifts of equity, which are not commission-based. </p>
