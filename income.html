<p style="colore:green;"> Income is defined in different ways depending on the context—for example, for purposes of taxation, financial accounting, or economic analysis. For individuals and businesses, income generally means the value or amount that they receive for their labor and products.<br><br>

Individuals generally consider their gross income to equal the total of their earnings in the form of wages and salaries, the return on their investments and sales of property, and other receipts. Their net income is composed of their gross income reduced by costs incurred in producing the income.<br><br>

Similarly, businesses generally treat their total receipts from services, products, and any interest and dividends received with respect to their cash accounts and reserves related to the business as their gross income. Businesses’ net income—i.e., profit—is determined by reducing their gross income by their business expenses.<br><br>  

Economists study income in varied contexts that employ different definitions and ways of measuring income.  Whether their studies involve earnings, savings, consumption, production, public finance, capital investment, or other related topics and subtopics, their concept of income will correspond to the purpose of their research. While the measure of income on a macro level is critical to societal and policy studies, individuals are more focused on their personal and business income. </p>
